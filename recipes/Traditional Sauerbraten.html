            <h2>Description</h2>
            <span>
                For this sauerbraten, I found two slightly different handwritten versions of my Grandmother's recipe.
                <br>
                 Born in Nekkar am Rhein in 1904, she naturally learned to cook traditional German meals as a young woman and didn't rely on a cookbook.
                 <br>
                  I try to capture the nuance in this. Serve with potato dumplings.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                <li>10 whole cloves, or more to taste</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves, or more to taste</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>10 gingersnap cookies, crumbled</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place beef rump roast, onions, vinegar, water, 1 tablespoon salt, 1 tablespoon black pepper, sugar, cloves, and bay leaves in a large pot. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 days, turning meat daily. Remove meat from marinade and pat dry with paper towels, reserving marinade. </li>
                <li>Season flour to taste with salt and black pepper in a large bowl. Sprinkle flour mixture over beef.  </li>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat; cook beef until brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Pour reserved marinade over beef, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until beef is tender, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Remove beef to a platter and slice. </li>
                <li>Strain solids from remaining liquid and continue cooking over medium heat. Add gingersnap cookies and simmer until gravy is thickened, about 10 minutes. Serve gravy over sliced beef.  </li>
            </ol>
