            <h2>Description</h2>
            <span>
                <p>My mom made this broccoli cheese casserole every Thanksgiving when I was little. We kids could never get enough!
                    <br>
                     If you have children or have some coming to visit you as guests this Thanksgiving, I guarantee that they will eat (and enjoy)
                    <br>
                     this veggie dish. It's also fabulous with a Christmas ham.</p>
